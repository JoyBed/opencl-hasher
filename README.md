# OpenCL-hasher
Implementation of OpenCL SHA1 hashing for DuinoCoin project. The main goal is to use OpenCL runtime to mine DUCOs using either GPU or CPU. Our intention is not to be greatest or best or to have better profit, but to have fun, learn something and maybe make a usefull miner for the public. This is using a different platform of mining (openCL).

# Currently in Development Phase

# Supported Instances : 
### Note: Run Multiple Instances at your risk. It can burn your GPU.
1. GPU Only (Single Instance/ Multiple Instance) : Yes
2. CPU OpenCL (Single Instance/ Multiple Instance): No
3. CPU + GPU (Single Instance/ Multiple Instance): No


# Requirements:

    numpy
    pybind11
    pyopencl
    colorama
    psutil
    gputil
    tabulate
