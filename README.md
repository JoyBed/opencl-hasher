# OpenCL-hasher
Implementation of OpenCL SHA1 hashing for DuinoCoin project. The main goal is to use OpenCL runtime to mine DUCOs using either GPU or CPU. Our intention is not to be greatest or best or to have better profit, but to have fun, learn something and maybe make a usefull miner for the public.

Requirements:
    numpy       pybind11
    pyopencl    colorama
    psutil      gputil
    tabulate    threading
